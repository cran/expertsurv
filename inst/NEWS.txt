Version 1.3.0 (2023-09-20)
-------------------------

Now that rstan 2.26 is available on CRAN we need to update the deprecated syntax in the package's Stan models, otherwise it will fail to install with an upcoming version of RStan.
The following updates have been made:
•	New array syntax
More information about the deprecated and removed syntax in Stan can be found here:
•	https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/deprecated-functions.html
•	https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/removed-functions.html

Also included in a new vignette on the Shiny application.


Version 1.2.0 (2023-07-21)
-------------------------

	* Include new function elicit_surv. This opens a Shiny application which interfaces with functions from the package and can be used to produce reports. 


   * Fixed issue with error_mod_normal and other functions; argument model was called when it should have been mode
   * For the penalized maximum likelihood model spline models resulted in an error ; DLSsurvspline was accessed in the wrong order with test.deriv
   * Error in the lik_lno function; resulted in incorrect likelihood for the expert opinion in the lognormal model
